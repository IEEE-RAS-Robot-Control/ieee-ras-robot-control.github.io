<h1 id="page-title" class="page-title"> Welcome to Technical Committee on Robot Control </h1>

<div class="notice">
    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>Our scope is to facilitate a vibrant, inclusive discourse that revitalizes the field of modeling and control,
    empowering emerging researchers to embrace and expand upon these disciplines as they shape the future of robotics research.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we believe that incentivizing Modeling and Control research will enhance the inclusivity of the RAS community. 
    Compared to other branches in robotics, M&C research demands fewer investments, 
    enabling broader participation from groups with limited access to funding for costly equipment and computational resources.</p>
