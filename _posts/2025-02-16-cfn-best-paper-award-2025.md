The IEEE-RAS Technical Committee (TC) on Robot Control invites nominations for the 2025 Best Paper Award. 

## Scope
The Best Paper Award of the TC on Robot Control recognizes outstanding papers published within a calendar year and honors the authors’ contributions to advancing the field of Robot Control. 
Nominations are open to TC members only. 

## How to apply
Nominations, including self-nominations, must be submitted by TC members.   Self-nominations are encouraged, with a limit of two papers per group. 
Any peer-reviewed paper relevant to the TC’s scope and published in 2024 is eligible. 
For journal papers, the electronic publication date will be considered, while for conference papers, the date of the main conference session applies. 

Please complete the nomination form (to be provided) and attach a PDF file of the nominated paper. 
Nominators should submit a summary of no more than 150 words, clearly stating why the paper deserves the Best Paper Award. 
The summary should emphasize the paper's originality, technical contributions, impact on the field, and any other relevant merits. 

**Restriction:**  
Papers co-authored by TC Co-Chairs are ineligible for nomination unless the first author was a student at the time of publication. 
This restriction applies only to Co-Chairs and not to Associate Co-Chairs. 
This policy helps avoid any perceived bias in selecting a Co-Chair’s paper as a winner or finalist while ensuring that students advised by or collaborating with the Co-Chairs are not unfairly disadvantaged.

Reviewers will be chosen for their expertise and to avoid conflicts of interest, safeguarding the integrity of the evaluation process.
